# Report the first coverage

Step by step guide on how to report your first coverage.

## Code instrumentation

Front-end engineering and modularization cannot be separated from babel. If your project is like this, you only need to install two babel plugins to start quickly.
[`babel-plugin-istanbul`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul) is a babel plugin maintained by istanbul officially.
[`babel-plugin-canyon`](https://github.com/canyon-project/babel-plugin-canyon) is a babel plugin for users to configure project information easily.

### Installation

```shell copy
npm i babel-plugin-istanbul babel-plugin-canyon -D
```

### Configuration

Configure in [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/config-files#configuration-file-types)
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "istanbul",
    "canyon"
  ]
}
```

After installing babel and starting the project, print **window.\_\_canyon\_\_** and **window.\_\_coverage\_\_** in the console. If it is the same as the following figure, congratulations, the code instrumentation is successful.

  Variables under Canyon will not exist in the local development environment. Only in the CI environment will environmental variables be detected.

## Configuration of environment variables during build

In the CI environment, we need to configure some environment variables for reporting coverage data.

### Obtain DSN and REPORTER

- DSN: The reporting interface provided by Canyon, url/coverage/client, where url is the address of Canyon's back-end service.
- REPORTER: User token, used to distinguish different users. You can view it on the user settings page.

### Configuration of variables on CI platform

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Branch, SHA, and Project ID do not need to be configured and will automatically read environmental variables. We have adapted to CI platforms such as gitlab pipeline and github action.
  For specific details, you can view <LocalizedLink href={'/documentation/reference/supported-ci-providers'}>the list of supported providers</LocalizedLink>.
</Callout>






## Testing and reporting

### UI automation

Users can use any UI automation testing framework, such as cypress, playwright, puppeteer, selenium, etc. Just report the coverage data after the test is completed.

For specific reference, see
<LocalizedLink href={'/documentation/end-to-end-testing/playwright'}>UI automation testing</LocalizedLink>.


### Manual reporting

Chrome browsers can use the Chrome plugin [canyon-extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/canyon-extension/omnpafdjidgpdmlimbangcjjaaodbeof?hl=zh-CN&utm_source=ext_sidebar) to manually report coverage data.

## Report viewing

Canyon provides rich reports, and you can view the summary and detailed coverage.
