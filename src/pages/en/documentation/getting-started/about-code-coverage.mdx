# About code coverage

## What is code coverage?

Code coverage is a measure used to represent which lines of code have been executed by a test suite. It has four dimensions.

- **Line coverage**: Has each line of code been executed?
- **Function coverage**: Has each function been called?
- **Branch coverage**: Has each branch been executed?
- **Statement coverage**: Has each statement been executed?

In simple terms, code coverage provides a visual measure to show which source code has been executed by the test suite. This information can help software developers determine where new tests should be written to strive for higher coverage.

## What does Canyon bring?

Code coverage tools motivate developers to write tests and improve coverage. During the process of writing tests, developers may find new errors or syntax problems in the source code. Solving these problems before releasing the application is very important.

Canyon focuses on end-to-end test coverage collection. End-to-end test coverage is used to ensure the code quality and functional integrity of the entire application under real user operations. It verifies the functionality of the application by simulating user behavior, identifying integration issues, preventing regression errors, and helping to optimize the user experience. This coverage enhances the team's confidence in code release and ensures the stability and reliability of the application in actual use.
